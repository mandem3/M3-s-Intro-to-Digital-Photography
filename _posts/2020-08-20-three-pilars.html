<p><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;">We've discussed ISO and Aperture, so that leaves the third pillar of photography: Shutter Speed.&nbsp; Your last&nbsp;micro-experiment for the week is included in this announcement.&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #2b78e4;"><em>The "Pillars of Photography" micro-experiments are not graded assignments, but I strongly encourage you to do them.</em></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span><br />In&nbsp;both film and digital cameras, <strong><span style="color: #9900ff;">the shutter speed determines the length of exposure</span></strong> (the amount of time during which light enters the camera and hits the film or digital sensor). &nbsp;In film cameras and older digital cameras, there was a moving part inside the camera body that slid in front of the film or sensor to manually block the light.&nbsp; In some newer cameras, the digital sensor just stops recording instead.&nbsp;<br /></span><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span><br />Shutter speed is measured in seconds. Most photographs are exposed for a fraction of a second.&nbsp;<br /></span></strong><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span><br />Shutter speed has two effects. &nbsp;The most obvious one is that a longer shutter speed lets more light in and the resulting image is brighter, while a shorter shutter speed means less light and a darker picture.&nbsp; However, remember that light is not passive input &mdash; it reflects a constantly-moving world. If you capture the light coming from 1/4000th of a second, then you'll get a reflection of very short slice of movement. &nbsp;Assuming you've set your focus correctly, the image will be very crisp and seem to "stop time."&nbsp; Likewise, as you capture the light from more extended periods, the camera will pick up the movement of the world outside its box. &nbsp;A moderately long exposure such as 1/6 will capture a motion blur on sudden movements (and probably camera shake). With a tripod and a 3 second shutter speed, you can capture a world of ghostly pedestrians. With an extremely long exposure, you can capture the movement of the earth itself (i.e., star trails)</span></p>

<p><br /><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;"><em>For this experiment, you'll need an assistant. If you have a kid old enough to understand the task, they make great assistants and it's a good family activity. &nbsp;Otherwise, you can use a spouse, friend, co-worker, pet &mdash; or even a self-moving object, like an oscillating fan.</em>&nbsp;<em>If you have a tripod, you'll want to use it for this assignment. Otherwise, set the camera down on an unmoving surface (e.g., a pile of books on a table) and try to avoid touching it very much. If you have a remote control for your camera, you may want to use it to further prevent shaking the camera.</em></span><br /><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, serif; color: #ffffff;"><em>.</em></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;">Have your assistant sit in one spot and make sure they're in focus. &nbsp;<br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;"><strong>Find your shutter speed controls.</strong> <span style="color: #2b78e4;"><em>(You may need to reference your camera's owner manual.)</em></span><br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;"><span style="color: #351c75;"><strong>Set your ISO to the lowest setting</strong></span> and then use your camera's automatic settings to find your "average" aperture for this project. Then, <strong><span style="color: #351c75;">change&nbsp;your shutter speed to 3 seconds</span></strong>.&nbsp;Have your assistant wiggle a lot while you take a picture. (This should end up very bright.)<br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;"><span style="color: #351c75;">Next,&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color: #351c75;">use aperture, ISO, and ambient light to make the background image properly exposed</span></strong>, and try again.&nbsp;Have your assistant wiggle a lot while you take a picture.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;"><span style="color: #351c75;"><strong>Set your ISO to the lowest setting (again)&nbsp;and also set aperture to the smallest f-stop.</strong> </span>Take photos of your wiggly assistant until you <strong>find out what shutter speed you need</strong> to balance out that setting.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;">Without changing ISO, <span style="color: #351c75;"><strong>change your aperture to its largest f-stop</strong></span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Take photos of your wiggly assistant until you <strong>find out what shutter speed you need</strong> to balance out that setting.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;"><span style="color: #351c75;"><strong>Set your ISO no higher than 500.</strong></span>&nbsp; <strong>Use your aperture and shutter speed together to try to freeze your wiggly assistant</strong> in mid-motion without any blur in the image. Try not to underexpose the image (you may not be able to achieve this, depending on the lighting).&nbsp;<br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: georgia, serif;">Consider what you observed. Were you able to freeze motion?&nbsp; Were you able to create interesting blurs?</span></li>
